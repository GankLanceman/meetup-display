# Dallas Reactjs Meetup Display

This is a project that I threw together in a few hours to display a simple example of a working React application

See it in action [here](https://ganklanceman.github.io/meetup-display/)

To run in development mode clone the repository to your local machine, run npm install on the target directory, then run npm start
